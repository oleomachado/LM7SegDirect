To Install:
-----------

1. Locate your arduino installation (ex. C:\Program Files\arduino-1.0.1\)
2. Inside this directory locate LIBRARIES
3. Unzip the downloaded library.
   3.1. This will create a folder named LM7SegDirect-master
   3.2. Rename from LM7SegShift-master to LM7SegDirect
4. Thats it. 

Open Arduino IDE and in the menu File/Examples/LM7SegDirect you will find some samples of how to use the library

If you have some problems in unziping the file, the final folder tree in the LIBRARIES should be:

C:\Program Files\arduino-1.0.1\
   \Libraries
      \LM7SegDirect
          = keyword.txt
          = LM7SegDirect.cpp
          = LM7SegDirect.h
      \examples
          \OneDigit
             = OneDigit.ino
          \TwoDigits
             = TwoDigits.ino
          \FourDigits
             = FourDigits.ino
